# SimpleToDo
To Do:
- Method to dismiss item from list (either through swipe, or check mark)
- Add red timer indicator to indicate task approaching deadline on list item view
- add placeholder when empty recyclerview
- when delete task, implement snackbar to undo
- When floating action button is pressed launch pager activity with fragment, but do not add a task(launch add command),
  instead launch the activity with fragment as normal and setup the task inside of the taskfragment with
  data input by the user, also add a button in the fragment to save the task(saving the task actually executes the add command instead of previous implementation)
- implement notifications. Hide the save button when fragment is launched in edit_task state.
    - reminders
- Backup and restore db
