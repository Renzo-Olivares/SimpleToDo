- fix up styles (5)
- implement dark mode (toggle by night mode setting from android and user facing toggle) (2)
- app launch screen and app icon(5)
- Fix picker dialogs and make rounded (5)
- fragment task list toolbar should have night mode toggle on right, and back up and restore launch on the left side of title (2)
- implement notifications. (5)
    - multiple reminders (2)

ideas:
- if app has not launched in a while present welcome screen with upcoming tasks
- pull down on list to reveal search
- toggle for reminds(ability to set multiple)
- I want to avoid having a settings page, why? to keep things as minimal as possible.
